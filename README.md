### Art Piece 1

This piece is called The Butcher's Son and was created by Mario Klingemann. I found this piece to be fascinating because it is a nude painting generated entirely by using two Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The first GAN extracts stick figures of human posses from a set of hundreds of thousands of photographs, and the second GAN increased the resolution and added texture and other details to create new types of aesthetics. Mario used pornography in his set because it provided a source of never-ending nudes. Mario presents an untraditional nude-painting, where the body isn't completely filled in and the face has no distinction, but it is so interesting to think about how AI can be used to create new images of human beings and their bodies.

## Art Piece 2

This piece of art was also created by Mario Klingemann, and he made it using Goggle's DeepDream. Klingeman ran a neural net that had been trained to identify dogs on an image of jelly fish. Because the neural net was trained to see dogs in unrelated imagery, it transformed the jelly fish into images (or partial images) of dogs. This transformation gives a trippy aesthetic, and I found it to be mesmorizing. I was intrigued not only by the variance in colors, but also by attempting to make out what which parts of the jelly fish image illicted just a dog head, only a dog body, etc.
